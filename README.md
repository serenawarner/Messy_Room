# Messy_Room
In my Multimedia Computing course, I was tasked with creating a game using the Pygame library. With two partners, I created a game titled, "Messy Room," where items in a room were randomly placed and had to be sorted to different locations in a bedroom. The player has a limited time amount in order to complete the game.
